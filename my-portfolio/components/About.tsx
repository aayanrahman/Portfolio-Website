          I'm a first-year Electrical Engineering student at the University of Waterloo, passionate about building
          systems that bridge the digital and physical worlds. My interests span high-speed digital design, embedded
          systems, RF/FPGA development, and PCB design using tools like KiCad and LTspice. When I'm not debugging
          circuits or writing code, you'll find me working on projects that solve real problemsâ€”from race car electrical
          systems to AI-powered applications.
